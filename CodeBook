Sourcing the file run_analysis.R will provide a dataframe called mean.std.measH.  This dataset provides  
average and standard deviation of each activity when grouped by activity and each subject. The dataset 
has 180 row and 81 columns.  Unless otherwise, the variables are numerical.  More details about the 
original data can be found in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" README.txt file

This dataset has the following variables:

ActivityNames           -Activity done by subject.  A categorical variable.
