# MyGetting-and-Cleaning-DataProject

This is the repository for my course project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  It contains the following files:
  
1.  run_analysis.R  -- A R file that contains code with comments that does the following with the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset:
    -- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    -- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    -- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    -- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    -- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. Codebook       -- The codebook for the dataset
